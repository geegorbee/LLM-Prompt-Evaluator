# 🧠 LLM Prompt Evaluator

A lightweight Python-based tool for simulating human-in-the-loop evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. This project enables structured scoring of AI responses using customizable rubrics and exports results to a CSV for further analysis. Ideal for testing prompts, auditing model behavior, or contributing to AI training pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Score LLM outputs using a configurable evaluation rubric
- ✍️ Rate categories like tone, clarity, completeness, and accuracy
- ✅ Flags unsafe or low-quality responses
- 📄 Logs results to CSV for performance tracking
- 🧩 Designed for extensibility and integration into prompt workflows

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Load the Python script**
2. **Enter prompt and model response**
3. **Assign ratings across four dimensions**
4. **System logs output to CSV**

Example evaluation rubric:

| Criterion    | Score (1–5) | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Clarity      | 5            | Easy to read and grammatically sound |
| Accuracy     | 4            | Mostly correct with minor issues     |
| Completeness | 3            | Misses some key details              |
| Tone         | 5            | Matches intended style/tone          |
